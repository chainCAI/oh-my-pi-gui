/**
 * Pool of per-tab sidecar processes.
 *
 * Each TAB owns one SidecarManager; a window holds N tabs. There is no tab
 * cap — a tab's process is spawned only once the tab is shown (deferStart),
 * so idle tabs cost nothing. The pool wires each sidecar's events to its
 * owning window, and releases the sidecar (listeners first, then dispose) when its
 * tab closes or its window closes.
 *
 * Event routing: the full event channels (events batch, status, subagent,
 * live, commands, config, prompt result, command output, session info,
 * extension ui/error, host tool/uri) forward from at most two VISIBLE tabs.
 * One of them is focused for untargeted commands. Every tab (visible or
 * background) additionally pushes the light TAB_STATUS channel, so background
 * tabs report status flips and session title/id changes.
 *
 * F-OWN (double-attach guard): `#sessionOwners` maps a session file to the
 * tab/window attached to it, registered at acquire (spawn-with-sessionPath),
 * from the RPC passthrough (switch_session success / get_state — the only
 * main-observable carriers of the file path), and dropped on release or when
 * session_info_update reports a sessionId change (the cached file is stale;
 * the renderer's hydrate re-registers the current one).
 *
 * F-UI-ORIGIN (response routing): extension_ui / host_tool / host_uri
 * requests raised by a tab are recorded by request id → owning entry, so a
 * renderer response routes back to the sidecar that RAISED the request even
 * after the user switched to another tab (sidecarForWindow would misroute
 * it to the newly active sidecar, which never saw the request).
